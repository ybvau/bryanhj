**Week 13 Field Outing Deliverable**

**Introduction**

The field outing for April 12, 2021, was significantly larger than the prior week&#39;s dataset&#39; there was a larger amount of ground covered by the Mavic. The deliverables for this task were to process the data with GCPs for standard Pix4D generation to output a DSM and an orthomosaic. My flight partner and myself were to conduct a flight capturing roughly 8 GCPs within the imagery. One key takeaway from the mission was a quote from Dr. Hupy, our instructor: &quot;fast is smooth and smooth is fast&quot;. In the spirit of smooth and fast, Matt (the PIC) and myself (VO) conducted the mission covering roughly 400m x 400m of ground to generate data for an orthomosaic and digital surface model in roughly fifteen minutes – something I believe would be our smoothest mission to date. This exercise in particular was a useful refresher for myself to become comfortable with establishing a general flight plan and running through the steps to ensure I would be prepared to conduct my own mission as a PIC, which I had the opportunity to do roughly ten days later.

**Study Area**

The area the mission was conducted at was the Purdue Wildlife Area – specifically the burn plots, neighboring fields, and construction areas, with Dr. Hupy&#39;s truck acting as a stand-in centroid for our polygon flight. The image shown is the orthomosaic compiled from the data generated and goes to show the general size of the mission.
