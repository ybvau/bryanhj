Below are general standard operating procedures adhered to in order to maintain a fully-functioning UAS dispatching operation (going off what I have learned and what seems to be necessary).
* SOP CHECKLISTS ARE WRITTEN TO FOLLOW PROPER PROCEDURES IN A STEP-BY-STEP FASHION. THE GOAL OF A CHECKLIST IS TO COVER ALL OF THE STEPS AND LEAVE NOTHING UP TO INTUITION. 
* The checklist is not written to be dummy-proof. It is, in fact ,written for the common UA.



### Check in/out Standard Operating Procedure

1. Request a vehicle using a form not unlike the Vehicle Request Form.(/static/files/VRF.pdf)
2. Ideally establishg a filing procedure for 24 hours in advance, otherwise the request will be disregarded.
3. Check in the vehicle ON TIME. If one runs behind schedule, let _dispatch_ KNOW. 

#### General guidelines Purdue UAS Dispatch adheres to
* If you're over an HOUR LATE, it will be marked down. 
* After 3 marks, no more dispatch per week.
* If it happens 4x = no aircraft can be dispatched to you. 
* Flights needed to be rearranged, cancelled, etc. if flights are LATE. They are to be  RETURNED ON TIME to ensure resources are shared accordingly. 


### Designing a Checklist Standard Operting Procedure

The checklist should be written for the common unmanned aviator. It is NOT MEANT TO BE DUMMY-PROOF. It would be considered proper etiquette to memorize which components of the used platforms are followed explicitly. The general checklist procedure commonly contains for procedures designed to be explicitly followed, with each containing sub-checklists that should be followed, as well.

Common etiquette is to STATE the step and then REPEAT the step after completion. NO ASSUMPTION WHATSOEVER. 

1. Unpacking
2. Assembling
3. Preflight
4. Launch
