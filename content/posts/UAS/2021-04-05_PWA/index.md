**Week 12 Field Outing Deliverable**

**Introduction**

The field outing for April 5, 2021, was three-pronged. First, my flight partner and I were to assemble and disassemble an M600 to ensure refined competency when assembling and disassembling the platform. After, we were to fly a GCP mission with the Mavic 2 Pro. Finally, we were to fly a perimeter mission of Purdue Wildlife Area to gather data for an SRT file to work with. These missions were conducted as a part of a training exercise.

_Assembly, Disassembly of M600_

The objective of this exercise was to familiarize ourselves with how the M600 is assembled and disassembled. This was led by a class member in AT 419 who walked the flight crews through the checklist and ensured there was mutual understanding for how the platform was assembled, disassembled, and activated.

_Flying a GCP Mission with the Mavic 2 Pro_

This mission was conducted to ensure competency with constructing and executing a general GCP-based mission. We were instructed to create and follow a general pathway for our UAS to execute and then successfully land and ensure data had been captured.

_Flying a Perimeter mission for an SRT file._

This mission itself was two-fold. The first portion was a manual flight around the perimeter of PWA in order to capture data for an SRT file to later be converted. The first portion of the mission had been completed successfully, and we are awaiting advice for the second portion.

**Study Area**

The mission was conducted above the fields located at PWA. The mission itself spanned about 300m by approximately 200m, creating a rectangular shape displayed post-processing. The orthomosaic itself extends past the GCP spots over 20% in some areas and approximately20% in others.

**Metadata: Provide a table that contains the key information related to your data collection mission.**
