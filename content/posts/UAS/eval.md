1.	Prior to this activity, how would you rank yourself in knowledge about the topic. (1-No Knowledge at all, 2-Very Little Knowledge, 3-Some knowledge, 4-A good amount of knowledge, 5-I knew all about this)
2.	Following this activity, how would you rate the amount of knowledge you have on the topic (1- I don’t really know enough to talk about the topic, 2- I know enough to explain what I did, 3-I know enough to repeat what I did, 4-I know enough to teach someone else, 5- I am an expert)
3.	Did the hands-on approach to this activity add to how much you were able to learn (1-Strongly Disagree, 2-Disagree, 3-No real opinion, 4-Agree, 5-Strongly Agree)
4.	What types of learning strategies would you recommend to make the activity even better?


### Chute Folding
1.	I would say I had no knowledge on this topic whatsoever. Fortunately the resources I had used to effectively understand how to fold a parachute specifically for the Bramor proved to be insightful, placing:
2.	at a higher level - I’d say I know enough to walk someone else through folding their own parachute, given the amount of times I re-did the steps to make sure they were done properly. 
3.	The hands-on approach was imperative. I can sit down, read, and ingest the gist of anything, but it requires my actually folding a parachute per say to understand the nuances and why steps are the way steps are.
4.	I would continue compiling walkthrough steps to afford the students useful content to reference and build their knowledge from.

### C3P
1. I had no experience; I'd give myself a 1. 
2. I'd say it was enough for me to be rougly conversational on the Bramor PPX; I'd say it boosted me to a 2.
3. The hands-on and tactile approach was imperative for me to learn. Without walking through the steps I would not have learned anything. 5
4. I'd recommend having all the students run through it. Muscle memory is highly under-utilized I've come to realize, and everyone suggests cracking open a textbook or following general orders. Within the scope of exploration and exploitation, it's useful to combine the two methods of learning to further improve the general understanding for a student.

### Cartographics
1. I had brief experience the semester prior. I'd put myself at a 2.
2. I appreciated running through the cartographic topics and what needs to be known. According to the feedback I received later in the semester, it appears I had been basing my education off of incorrect factors (not accounting for a few very poor answers on my end). I wouldn't consider myself an expert by any means. 2
3. Tactile is imperative. 5
4. ArcPro takes time to work with, and it likely takes multiple exercises further than simply having students run through it once. I feel we can maange if that's the case, but routinely running through the same thing -- a lot like the parachute folding assignment -- is an amazing way to reinforce the education.

### ArcPro
1. I had brief experience the semester prior. I'd put myself at a 2.
2. I appreciated running through it, and it was good to identify what I needed to know and revisit things I only brushed past the semester prior. I wouldn't consider myself an expert by any means. 2
3. Tactile is imperative. 5

### MGC Familiarization
1. This was a relatively intuitive app to use, and it was good to re-run through the motions. I'd put myself at a 3 starting out on this.
2. Re-running thorugh it and being able ot ask questions about things I was not confident about really helped. 4
3. Tactile is imperative. 5
4. Have students set up a mission in the classroom, then take them out to execute it would be useful -- essentially the exact way it'd be done in the field would really work wonders. Setting up in the field feels a tad hasty and I feel I could have benefit appreciate a dry-run within the class and the immediately going out in the field to execute it the same day/the day after.

### Volumetrics
1. I had no clue what volumetrics were before class. 1
2. I thought I had, but if the feedback is correct, it has to be a 1. Had my submission acquired a grade it'd likely be a 2 to validate I learned things and waas right about what I wrote submitted something of value. A lot to learn!
3. It should have. Tactile is imperative.
4. I'd appreciate specific feedback on this assignment in a timely fashion where I could reference it before continuing on with the class thinking I was up to par. The feedback was useful but it would have been nicer to discover earlier in the semester.

### Wk12-15 Deliverables 
1. Compiling everything we learned in class to execute the deliverables was something I am comfortable with, even if at least generally. I'd put myself at a 2.
2. It was really nice to run through everything and see the result. 3.
3. Tactile is imperative!!!
4. This was an absolute blast to work on. Seeing everything come to fruition was something I had looked forward to, and I'm grateful I got the opportunity to put all of what I'd learned together. I'd love to see this take place way earlier in the semester!
