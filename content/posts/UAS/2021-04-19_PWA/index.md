**Week 14 Field Outing Deliverable**

**Introduction**

The field outing for April 19, 2021, was, I believe, the most crisp imagery we managed to capture. For some reason or another (I&#39;d personally credit Matt&#39;s skillset with mission planning), the images came out looking spectacular with little to no stitching visible once all of the images were compiled. This was also the first outing our group used ArcCollector data effectively and mapped it against the actual GCP data. Interestingly, the GCP coordinates were loosely correlated; just about as consistent as the average of all the data we supplied using ArcCollector across about eight individuals&#39; phones.

**Study Area**

The area the mission was conducted at was the Purdue Wildlife Area â€“ specifically the burn plots, neighboring fields, and construction areas. The image shown is the orthomosaic compiled from the data generated and goes to show the general size of the mission.

**External Deliverables**

Additionally requested were orthomosaics of:

- Actual GCP location shown from above
