CTR CLOCKWISE E/A GRABHANDLE: LIFT OFF, SET DOWN KEEP DISTANCE FROM PEOPLE UNPACKING THE COMPONENT BOXES   SOP CHECKLISTS ARE WRITTEN TO FOLLOW PROPER PROCEDURES IN A STEP-BY-STEP FASHION. THE GOAL OF A CHECKLIST IS TO COVER ALL OF THE STEPS AND LEAVE NOTHING UP TO INTUITION. The checklist is not written to be dummy-proof. It is, in fact ,written for the common UA.  Checklist Standard Operating Procedures\nThe checklist is an imperativestep of proper mission execution and ettiquette. It\u0026rsquo;s highly encouraged to either reference the OEM checklist or devise one\u0026rsquo;s own.\nDesigning a Checklist The checklist should be written for the common unmanned aviator. It is NOT MEANT TO BE DUMMY-PROOF. It would be considered proper etiquette to memorize which components of the used platforms are followed explicitly. The general checklist procedure commonly contains for procedures designed to be explicitly followed, with each containing sub-checklists that should be followed, as well.\nCommon etiquette is to STATE the step and then REPEAT the step after completion. NO ASSUMPTION WHATSOEVER.\n Unpacking Assembling Preflight Launch  Unpacking Unpacking is the first of the four components and is also the most crucial in terms of inspection. The unpacking section of the checklist should be designed with ensuringall of the components are in proper operating condition. This section shouldfocus on checking the hardware components and establishing them in a proper operatingcondition. For this example, we will review the unpacking section of the C-Astral Bramor PPX.\n  KESTREL: ON\n This is the weather-checker. Remove theweather-checker and turn it on. ensure it is in operating condition. If it does not work, it isstrongly advised to not continue with the mission and remedy the issue immediately.    Catapult: UNFOLDED\n Ensure the catapult is UNFOLDED.   This is the launchign pltform of the UAS. It is designed to propel the UAS in the air at ~60mph with a payload of over 10lbs.    Catapult Legs: EXTENDED\n Imperative to ensure proper launch base.    Catapult Legs Safety Locks: SECURE\n Imperative to ensure proper launch base.    Catapult Middle Lock: SECURE\n Imperative to ensure proper launch base.    Catapult Safety Pin: SECURE\n Imperative to ensure proper launch base. Unsecured safety pin can result in a downed platform.    Catapult on Level Ground: CHECK\n Ensure that the platform is properly aligned for take-off.    Winch Rope: EXTEND\n     Winch Rope State: CHECK\n  Breaking RopeState: CHECK\n  Bungee State: CHECK\n  Rubber not Armed: CHECK\n  Wind Direction: CHECK\n  Combox Antenna: CONNECT\n  GCS Com-Box: ON\n  GCS Tablet: ON\n  Com-Box Battery: CHECK\n  Tablet Battery: CHECK\n  Tablet Sound: ENABLED\n  Bluetooth: PAIRED\n  C3P: On\n  Payload Sensor: SELECTED\n    Assembly The aircraft should be assembled with extensive precaution. The aircraft can and will break should it get caught on something. Composites are designed to be strong in the direction they are supposed to withstand the force from.\nCommon Etiquette results in ensuring you\u0026rsquo;re tracking where the parts of the aircraft are. If there is a misplaced wingtip, there is significant dangert of potentially stepping on and by proxy breaking the wing tip.\n Airframe and Wing Connectors: CHECK  The airframe and wing connector should be checked for critically damaged areas to ensure that the platform will operate safely and without mishap.   Airframe on Catapult: PLACE  Placing the airframe on the catapult is to ensure the proper weight and balance of the platform; by proxy, ensuring safe flight.   Wing Joiners in Area Airgrame on Antenna: CONNECT  Connecting the antenna enables the UAS to communicate effectively.   Wings on Airframe: CONNECT  Carry the wings vertically. PIC should install left wing to ensure communication with Bramor. This is platform-specific. It is advised to PLACE FRMO ABOCE. If it does not slide on and there is resistance, that is because it is MISPLACED. Very little foreisrequired.  There shouldNEVER be a large amount of physical forceapplied on the platform.     Winglets on wings: CONNECT  Wingtips are to face in the SWEPT-BACK position, and the angle of connection should be properly aligned. Otherwise, friction-locking will result in an unsecure platform, which then results in potential mishap.   Wing gap tape: SEAL  The tape is placed starting from the back and folding just over the front end. Gently adhere the tape onto the aircraft wing gap. Cut with a knife adn ensure that only the tape is cut. Cover from back to forward. Cover the top and the leading edge bottom. If something else is snipped by mishap, abort mission until the issue is remedied. Seal the wing gaps on both the FUSELAGE edge and the WINGTIP edge.   Pitot Tube: CLEAN  You\u0026rsquo;re checking the pitot\u0026rsquo;s side-gaps and front. Since it lands on itsbelly, it occasionaly gets dirt within the pitot tude. It is recommened to GENTLY REMOVE dirt or debris. Do NOT shove dirt BACKWARDS. You can also blow through the pitot tube from the back-side. Blowing compressed air into the front of the pitot-static system will result in pitot error. When checking the pitot tube, you remove the cover and then replace the cover. the goal is to ensure nothing can get into it.   Propellor: CHECK  Inspect for leading, trailing edge damage.  Trailing edge damage is surpsingly common; especially with spinning props. Propellors areNOT suposed to move via a finger-tightened screw movement check.     Sensor Cable: CONNECTD  This is the larger cable from camera to the socket. There\u0026rsquo;s a little screw-it\u0026rsquo;s on the right side. Ensure it is tightened.   Parachute hatch: REMOVED Formatted memory card: FORMATTED, IN PLACE USB KEY: INSERTED  Touch it to make sure it is there.   UAV BATTERY: PLACE  It is snug. It\u0026rsquo;s imperative to ensure it\u0026rsquo;s placed properly. There may be resistance - be gentle when placing it in, but there may be LIGHT force involved here. Ensure to their proper terminals and ensure tha balancing cords are in the proper location.   Y Connector: ATTACHED TO BATTERY  Remove Y-conn and then attach to the alternate side.  This is to ensure both batteries get attached at the same time. This is imperative for proper operations.     UAV BATTERY: Connect  BEFORE CONNECTING  Ensure Com-box is ON Ensure C3P is OPEN     ESC Sound: PLAYED Camera Settings: CHECK Hatch: SECURE  This will take time. It requires PATIENCE and tactilty.  There is a single separation layer in between the composites that you slide into. Once placedi n the proper position, pull hatch up and it latches back down.     Airframe: SECURE Airframe linked to GCS: CHECK Parachute: POP  Ground-check the pop command operates. The parachute servo MUST remain clear of obstruction. Under no condition should it be covered. If ther eis something in the way, the servo will add power until the servo blows itself up. This is a failsafe device to ensure the device will POP when NECESSARY and not result in catatonic platform error.   Parachute: INSTALL Parachute Hatch RESET (Close, open, close procedure): CLOSE  Replace the hatch onto the machine.   Parachute Safety Pin: REMOVE  Ensuresthe parachute can and will deploy when the chute is popped without error.    Preflight  Mission: OPEN/CREATE Payload Sensor Selected: CHECK UAV Battery: CHECK Communication: CHECK Satellites: MORE THAN 7 Navigation Map: LOADED Photo Log: CLEARED Airframe from Catapult: REMOVE Mode to Maunal: SET  Switched from the GTEC. The flight mode must be changed to check flight modes.   Servo: CHECK Propellor Safety: CHECK Motor Test: CHECK Mode to safe: SET Lens Clean: CHECK  When checking thge lens, keep handsas close as possible to the center ofgravity dots. If the lens needscleaning, clean WITH THE LENS-CLEANING WIPES in the pack.  IF THERE ARE LOW LENS CLEANING WIPES, MAKE NOTE ON MISSION DETAILS TO ENSURE REPACKING INCLUDES PROPER LENS. SET THE SENSOR TO INFINITY. IT MUST BE INFOCUS.     Airframe: LEVEL  Ensure proper weight and balance.   Sensor Initialization: SET  TURN ON THE CAMERA/PAYLOAD/DEVICE. UseGTEC - Check flashing lights on app - tap sensor init - set temperature what Kestrel registers temperature at. Pressure init is BASED ON TEMPERATURE. Ensure temperature init is proper. Be as close as possible at 0 elevation when calibrating sensor to ensure altitude accuracy. Within field, When the sensor initializzes and sets, it sets it at ZERO.   Waypoints (Speed, Altitude): CHECK  Upload and ensure waypoints.   Mission (T\u0026amp;L, P, R): SET Takeoff Point Parameter: CHECK Landing Points Parameter: CHECK Auto Camera Switch: SELECT Mission: UPLOAD Failsafes: CHECK  Thisdevicehas NO OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE. Loss ofcomms - generally set to 1min -   Sensor Initialization: CHECK Airspeed: CHECK  Ensure 0m/s   Pitot Cover: REMOVE Pitot Test: CHECK  Cover the pitot tube front-end and ensure the pitot registers a light amount of pressure. The goal is to ensure that the \\pitot tube can read up to 10m/s.    Launch The final step of the checklist is the launch portion. Once this begins, all but PIC and LOS go behind\n Trolley: LOCK Rubbers: ON  Bungeesetup: one, one, two, two . WHEN ARMING, DO NOT CROSS BUNGEES. After arming, check partner\u0026rsquo;s bungee wrapping. Walk BEHIND the catapult. IF IMPROPERLY PLACED (CROSSED):  Remove bungees IN SEQUENTIAL ORDER. (4L, 4R, 3L, 3R, etc) ALWAYS remove bungees by stretching frmo halfway back to ensure ther eis room to grab/stretch the bungee. Once bungees are ON, all NOT ON FLIGHT CREW are AWAY.     Catapult Safety: CHECK Catapult wind direction: CHECK Catapult: ARM (1 minute max) Airframe on Catapult: SECURE Propellor: ALIGN Takeoff mode: SET UAV into TKO mode: CHECK Leg on plate: PLACE Safety pin: REMOVE  Pretension is REQUIRED. The amount of tension on the catapult will result in bodily injury. Pull cross-body.   Safety - Situational Awareness - CHECK Catapult release: PULL  Disassembly/teardown: PIC works left in, first office works right in  Upon removal of the wing, hook antennae back in the wing. Wingletsgo CONNECTOR facing out Left wing goes on TOP CASE right wing goes BOTTOM-top If you can\u0026rsquo;t get batteries removed - PULL LEFT FIRST. HOLD RIGHT ONE DOWN. BREAK FRICTION LOCK - NOT THE PLATFORM. When tearing down catapuly: take ALL BUNGEES and hold to RIGHT SIDE. Hold bungees ABOVE CATAPULT during placement wihthin case - then place bungees on top,.  There is success due to struggling - ensure ther e is a challenge Parrot back-forth the steps as they are accomplished.\n","date":"December 31, 1969","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://hugo-toha.github.io/posts/uas/bramor-checklist/","summary":"Archive !!Hupy \u0026amp; Lercel set gold standards!!

This project was initially kickstarted due to a need for a SSOT for UAS and GIS operations for non-UAS major pilots who need to conduct an aerial mission.\nLike the idea? Help build it. Shoot me an email if you\u0026rsquo;re intrigued. I\u0026rsquo;m primarily looking for partners passionate and interested in building this index to save Purdue faculty tasked with monitoring the operations a headache by means of giving the information aspiring Purdue aviators need to conduct their mission.\n","date":"December 31, 1969","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://hugo-toha.github.io/posts/uas/uagis-overview/","summary":"The information I\u0026rsquo;ve written on my portfolio can also be found on the UAGIS website \u0026ndash; my SSOT index for Purdue University unmanned aviators.\nThe Goal I built the UAGIS project with the goal of enabling aspiring aviators to have a single-source of truth index to reference before taking a drone into the field to ensure they are part 107 compliant and following the rules and guidelines set by the university.","tags":null,"title":"UAGIS Overview"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Go Notes ","date":"January 1, 0001","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://hugo-toha.github.io/notes/go/_index.bn/","summary":"Go Notes ","tags":null,"title":"Go এর নোট সমূহ"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.\nNo content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html\nSetting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.\nThis implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js\nInitial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml ``` [outputs] home = [\u0026ldquo;HTML\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;JSON\u0026rdquo;] ```\nSearching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.\nEdit layouts/_default/index.JSON This exposes the values in /index.json i.e. add category ``` \u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;contents\u0026rdquo;:{{ .Content | plainify | jsonify }} {{ if .Params.tags }}, \u0026ldquo;tags\u0026rdquo;:{{ .Params.tags | jsonify }}{{end}}, \u0026ldquo;categories\u0026rdquo; : {{ .Params.categories | jsonify }}, \u0026hellip; ```\nEdit fuse.js options to Search static/js/search.js ``` keys: [ \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;contents\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;tags\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;categories\u0026rdquo; ] ```\n","date":"January 1, 0001","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://hugo-toha.github.io/search/","summary":"This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.\nNo content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html\nSetting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.\nThis implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js\nInitial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml ``` [outputs] home = [\u0026ldquo;HTML\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;JSON\u0026rdquo;] ```","tags":null,"title":"Search Results"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","date":"January 1, 0001","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://hugo-toha.github.io/notes/_index.bn/","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"নোট সমূহ"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Bash Notes ","date":"January 1, 0001","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://hugo-toha.github.io/notes/bash/_index.bn/","summary":"Bash Notes ","tags":null,"title":"ব্যাশের নোট সমূহ"}]
